# Numerical-Simulation-and-Parameter-Inference-for-the-Diffusion-Equation
**Overview**

This project implements a numerical forward–inverse modeling pipeline for the 1D diffusion equation.
The goal is not just to simulate diffusion, but to estimate the diffusion coefficient from noisy observations using a physics-based numerical model.

The project demonstrates:

- finite-difference discretization of a PDE

- stability-aware numerical simulation

- synthetic data generation with noise

- parameter estimation via error minimization

- analysis of limitations inherent to inverse diffusion problems

**Mathematical Model**

We consider the 1D diffusion equation:

∂u(x,t) / ∂t ​ = D ∂2u(x,t) / ∂x2​​

where:

-u(x,t) is the diffusing quantity

-D is the diffusion coefficient (unknown in the inverse problem)

-x ∈ [0,L], t∈[0,T]

**Numerical Method**

The equation is discretized using an explicit finite difference scheme:

- Spatial domain discretized into Nx grid points

- Time discretized into Nt steps

- Central difference for the second spatial derivative

- Forward difference for the time derivative

The update rule for interior points is:
	**uin+1​=uin​+r(ui+1n​−2uin​+ui−1n​)**

where:
	r = DΔt ​/ Δx2​

**Stability**

The explicit scheme requires:

𝑟 ≤ 0.5

The solver enforces this condition and raises an error if violated.

**Boundary Conditions**

No-flux (Neumann) boundary conditions are used:

∂x / ∂u = 0 at boundaries

Implemented by mirroring the nearest interior values.

**Forward Simulation**

The forward solver (solver_1d.py) simulates diffusion from an initial localized spike at the center of the domain.

This initial condition is chosen because it:

-clearly demonstrates spreading behavior

-preserves symmetry

-makes numerical issues immediately visible

**Synthetic Data Generation**

Synthetic observations are generated by:

1.Running the forward solver with a fixed “true” diffusion coefficient D_true

2.Selecting a subset of time steps as observation points

3.Adding zero-mean Gaussian noise to simulate measurement error

The clean forward model is never corrupted; noise is added only to observed data, reflecting realistic experimental conditions.

The synthetic dataset is saved in NumPy .npz format for reproducibility.

**Parameter Estimation (Inverse Problem)**

The inverse problem consists of estimating D from noisy observations.

**Approach

-Candidate values of D are sampled within the numerically stable range

-For each candidate:

1.the forward solver is run

2.simulated profiles at observed times are extracted

3.a mean squared error (MSE) is computed against observed data

-The value of D minimizing the error is selected

This is a physics-constrained inverse problem, not a machine learning approach.

**Results**
Estimated Diffusion Coefficient

True diffusion coefficient: 
D_true = 0.2

Estimated diffusion coefficient: 
D ≈ 0.209

The estimate closely matches the true value despite added noise.

**Interpretation**

The small discrepancy arises due to:

- measurement noise

- numerical discretization error

- smoothing and ill-conditioning inherent to diffusion

- finite resolution of the parameter search

These effects are expected in inverse diffusion problems.

Plots Included (Demo & Evidence)
1. Diffusion Evolution (Forward Model)

What to show:

- Spatial profiles at selected time steps (e.g. t = 0, 50, 100, 200, 500)

Why it matters:

- Verifies numerical correctness

- Shows spreading, symmetry, and decay

- Demonstrates stable, physical behavior

2. Error vs Diffusion Coefficient

What to show:

Mean squared error as a function of candidate D

Why it matters:

- This is the core inverse problem result

- Shows identifiability of D

- Visualizes the effect of noise and model sensitivity

This plot is the key evidence that parameter estimation works.

**Limitations**

- Explicit finite difference scheme limits time step size due to stability constraints

- Diffusion smooths information, making the inverse problem ill-conditioned at late times

Estimation accuracy degrades with increased noise

- Only 1D diffusion is considered in this implementation

These limitations are intrinsic to the problem and motivate further extensions.

**Possible Extensions**

- Extension to 2D diffusion

- Implicit or semi-implicit time-stepping schemes

- Finer parameter search or uncertainty quantification

- Application to real experimental or benchmark datasets
